I now live in Wenatchee WA, and really enjoy working with small to medium-sized businesses where I get to meet the people who will use the software I build. Working with them to build something that makes their work life MUCH easier is what it’s all about.<br><br>When I say 'take back time', it really is true. We all have repetitive, necessary tasks that are part of running our business and these can often be very manual and time-consuming.  Making software that allows a computer to handle those tasks literally gives you time back to focus on your priorities.<br><br>I like to work closely with my customers. It starts with discussions about how your business operates,  identifying key processes, presenting solutions, and iterating on those ideas until you like what you see. Once the design is complete, we start building.  I regularly release new versions so you can see, click, and assess the software. You are along for the ride every step of the way, not just getting postcards in the mail.<br><br>Finally, in our world, things change, sometimes very quickly. I'm here for you. I can update your software as needs change in a timely manner. I’m a real person just a phone call away."

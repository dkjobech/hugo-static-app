Now I live in Wenatchee WA and I really enjoy meeting the people who will use the software I build and working with them to build something that makes thier work life MUCH easier. <br> <br> I say above that I 'steal time' and it realy is true.  We all have repetative, unfufilling tasks that are requied in order to keep doing the things we enjoy at work.  Making software that allows a computer to handle those tasks litterally steals time back for doing the other important things that grow your business. <br> <br> I like to work closely with my customers. It starts with discussions about how the task works, identifying the your key parts, presenting ideas and iterating on those ideas until you like what you see.  Then we start building.  I try to release a new version of my software each week to a location you can see and click and assess. This way you are along for the ride and can provide input, not just getting postcards along the way. <br> <br>  Finally, in our world, things change.  I'm here for you.  I can update your software as your requierments change and as you identify more tasks that may be useful to automate."

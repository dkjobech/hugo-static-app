A local transportation company gets many of their ride opportunities through a third-party medical ride scheduler. Each day the transportation company logs into their third-party scheduler’s website, downloads an Excel spreadsheet and then copies the details of each ride into their drivers’ daily manifests.  Besides being tedious and time-consuming, the process was often fraught with errors.  

The company already had a solution provided by another developer who had since stopped supporting them.  I was able to quickly assess and understand the existing code and fix some immediate shortcomings. Then I went on to recreate the functionality in a much more  efficient workflow which not only cut out a major external, but also enhanced the stability of the application.  The new application automated the login, browsing and downloading process. It parsed the rides and placed them as events on a calendar where the user could simply drag rides to the driver’s calendar and click a button to produce the driver’s daily manifest. These automated processes significantly  reduced the time it took to schedule rides and virtually eliminated what could have been embarrassing mistakes.

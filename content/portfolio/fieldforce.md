Most people don’t even know they have a backflow device, but it still must be tested every year. The process involves having a local tester test the device,  fill out a paper form including the test data, then submit the form by scanning each sheet and emailing it to the local water purveyor. The paperwork can take as long as the tests!

I built a mobile/web hybrid application to automate this process from beginning to end.  Now, when a new customer calls, the tester can collect the customer’s information using either their computer, if at home, or their phone, if out on the job and schedule an appointment right then and there. On test day, the application automatically sets the tester’s route for maximum efficiency and provides directions... Once at a job, test parameters can be entered directly into the phone, which ensures only acceptable values are entered helping eliminate errors. .  Upon returning home, the application either automatically generates and sends the necessary paperwork via email or logs into the purveyor’s website and filling out the pages and submitting the results.  When all is complete, the application sends each customer  a copy of their results via email and the tests are automatically pushed to a billing system..  Over the span of three years, the application enabled the owner to cut his time in half for each test allowing him to schedule more jobs per day and double  his business.

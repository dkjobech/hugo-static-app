An accountant and mother of 3, this small business owner easily prepared the taxes for her own nanny. She even prepared the taxes for a few of her friends.  But when friends started referring friends, manually entering data and calculating taxes consumed so much of her time she could no longer accept new clients. She knew her system had to change.

The custom software solution I created for her not only significantly improved her efficiency, but it also ensured greater accuracy and gave her clients secure access and management of their own information.  For the owner, I completely eliminated the weekly task of collecting hours and distributing paystubs as well as automated her tax filing process…a feature she estimates saves her 120 hours per quarter. For the customer, I provided secure online access to enter hours, view paystubs, review quarterly and yearly reports, and make changes where needed.  The business owner could now accept new customers and continue growing her business.  Since the first release, her business has grown fivefold and she has more time to spend with her family. A win-win for everyone.

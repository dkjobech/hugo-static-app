An accountant and mother of 3, this small business owner easily prepared the taxes for her in-him childcare serveries.  She even prepared the taxes for a few of her friends.  But when friends started referring others friends and her business grew manually tracking and calculating taxes for more and more people consumed so much of her time she could not long keep growing. She knew her process had to change and remove her.

Dan’s solution not only significantly improved he efficiency, it also insured a greater accuracy and gave her clients secure access and management of their own information.  She was completely removed from the weekly task of collecting hours and distributing paystubs.  No customers can log in, enter hours, view paystubs, review quarterly and yearly reports and make changes where needed.  Meanwhile, the business owner was freed up to onboard new customers and work on growing her business many times.  Since the first release we’ve automated more tasks. One module logs into state systems and submits payments for all of her customers.  She estimates this feature alone savers her 120 hours a quarter and significantly improves accuracy.

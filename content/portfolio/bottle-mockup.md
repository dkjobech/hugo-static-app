Imagine you became a pro at nanny payrol taxes when your kids were young.  Flash forward a couple years and your friends (and thier friends) are asking you to handle thier nanny payrol as well. You put together a pretty snazy spreadsheet to handle it and now you take hours from 50+ customers each week, enter them in a workbook built just for that employee and return the paystub the workbook kicks out.  At the end of the year, you produce 50+ W2s all by hand, with no mistakes.  Your fun little business suddenely isn't so fun.  You need...

* A place customers can enter thier own data and hours
* A paystub engine that calcualates the correct taxes and pay, every time
* Reports your customers can access that sum up payments/taxes over a quarter or year
* To be able to build formatted files the government will except to file taxes amounts
* Ability to open websites and populate payment fields for each of your customers
* A way to send and track your own invoices
* Your time back


> I built this system for JJ! Now, with MANY more customers, she's focused on more important things, not moving data.
